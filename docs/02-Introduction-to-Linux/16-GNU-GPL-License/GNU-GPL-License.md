## What is copyleft?

`Copyright` is a law that restricts the right to use, modify, and share creative works without the permission of the copyright holder.

 When an author releases a program under a `copyleft` license, he makes a claim on the copyright of the work and issues a statement that other people have the right to use, modify, and share the work as long as the `reciprocity obligation` is maintained.

 `Reciprocity obligation` means that any software that is written based on any GPL component must be released as open source with its full source code and all of the rights to modify and distribute the entire code.
