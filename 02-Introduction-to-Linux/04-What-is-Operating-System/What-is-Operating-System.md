An operating system is a software which acts as an interface between the end user and computer hardware. All applications like Chrome, MS Word, Games, etc need an Operating system to run on.

## History Of OS
- First developed in 1950s to manage tape storage
- First version of the Unix OS was developed in 1960s
- Microsoft build the first OS named `DOS` in 1981
- Windows OS first came to existence in 1985 when a GUI was created.

## Features of Operating System

- Program Execution
- Memory management
- Handling I/O operations
- Resource allocation
- Networking Security
- disk access and file systems
- Device drivers
- Error Detection and handling
- Information and Resource Protection


## What is a Kernel
- Kernel is the core part of an operating system which facilitates access to system hardware resource like CPU, Storage, Network Access, Connectivity etc.

## Features of Kernel
- Low-level scheduling of processes
- Inter-process communication
- Process synchronization
- Context switching
- Access to Network Devices via Device Drivers.
- Access to USB Devices via Device Drivers.
- Access to Storage via Filesystem and Device Drivers.
- Access to IOT/Embedded Devices via Device Drivers.

## Types of Kernels

### Monolithic
A Monolithic kernel is an OS architecture where the entire operating system (which includes the device drivers, file system, and the application IPC) is working in kernel space. Monolithic kernels are able to dynamically load (and unload) executable modules at runtime.

### Microkernels

A Monolithic kernel is an OS architecture where the operating system (which includes the device drivers, file system, and the application IPC) is implementaed as seperate services all runnning in their seperate kernel address space and user address space. 

### Functions of an Operating System
- Process management
- Memory management
- File management
- Device Management
- I/O System Management
- Secondary-Storage Management
- Security
- Command interpretation
- Networking
- Job accounting and Statistics
- Communication management
