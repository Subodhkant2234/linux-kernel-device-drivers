| Development | Linux is Open Source, and thousands of programmer collaborate online and contribute to its development | Unix systems have different versions. These versions are primarily developed by AT&T as well as other commercial vendors. |
| User | Everyone. From home users to developers and computer enthusiasts alike. | The UNIX can be used in internet servers, workstations, and PCs. |
| Text made interface | BASH is the Linux default shell. It offers support for multiple command interpreters. | Originally made to work in Bourne Shell. However, it is now compatible with many others software. |

| Threat detection | Threat detection and solution is very fast because Linux is mainly community driven. So, if any Linux user posts any kind of threat, a team of qualified developers starts working to resolve this threat. | Unix users require longer wait time, to get the proper bug fixing patch |
| Architectures | Initially developed for Intel's x86 hardware processors. It is available for over twenty different types of CPU which also includes an ARM. | It is available on PA-RISC and Itanium machines. |
| Usage | Linux OS can be installed on various types of devices like mobile, tablet computers. | The UNIX operating system is used for internet servers, workstations & PCs. |
| Best feature | Kernel update without reboot | Feta ZFS - next generation filesystem DTrace - dynamic Kernel Tracing |
| Versions | Different Versions of Linux are Redhat, Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Solaris, etc. | Different Versions of Unix are HP-UX, AIS, BSD, etc. |
| Supported file type | The Filesystems supported by file type like xfs, nfs, cramfsm ext 1 to 4, ufs, devpts, NTFS. | The Filesystems supported by file types are zfs, hfx, GPS, xfs, vxfs. |
| Portability | Linux is portable and is booted from a USB Stick | Unix is not portable |
| Source Code | The source is available to the general public | The source code is not available to anyone. |
